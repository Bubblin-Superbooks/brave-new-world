The man looked at him, then again at Linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. Linda said, 'No.' But the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. 'No,' Linda said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. 'No, no!' But the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. He screamed. The man put out his other hand and lifted him up. Linda was still holding him, still saying 'No, no.' The man said something short and angry, and suddenly her hands were gone. 'Linda, Linda.' He kicked and wriggled; but the man carried him across to the door, opened it, put him down on the floor in the middle of the other room, and went away, shutting the door behind him. He got up, he ran to the door.</p></div> </div>
